# Social-Media-App-IOS

a few hours before the project was due my data base got messed up. The original objective of this app was to have users sign up and login with a unique email and password to the social media platform called whistle. At the moment all my app does is switch between a few view controllers and have button functionality. Im able to type an email and a password(blocked characters when typing password for privacy)
